Our hospitalist group schedule is on amion.com. It's a useful site, but one
thing missing is a nice day-view. Specifically, I want to know each of the
daytime hospitalists working on a given day, and know which day of their
cycle they are on.

This program parses the monthly calendar (and pulls the month before and
month after, in case we need those dates as well). It then figures out
which hospitalists are on, and then for each hospitalist, how many days
they have worked so far, and how many days they have left.

The current version is a test only, so it loads the test files
(amion3-5.html) which have fake names and data. It can be adapated easily
to load the online version.

Contact vinod@kurup.com with any questions.
